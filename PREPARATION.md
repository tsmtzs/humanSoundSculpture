# Preparation
Performers of *Human Sound Sculpture* use a smartphone device to connect to a local WIFI TLS network. By using the browser they direct to the website of the piece. Recent versions of the most well-known browsers should work. In general, the website should work on every browser that supports the `WebSocket` protocol and the `Web Audio API`.

Performers direct to the website by typing the `IP` address and the `HTTP` port inside the address bar. So, if the `IP` is `192.168.100.1` and the port is `3000`, they should type `https://192.168.100.1:3000`. Performers should be informed that the browser will show the warning
```
Your connection is not private
```

The website is developed as a PWA. Performers can, if they wish, download the website to their device. If so, an icon will appear on the home screen. This is done for the benefit of those who don't want to type the address. The TLS certificate should have been installed in order for the website to run as an app. Alternatively, they can bookmark the page from within the browser.

A `TEST` button appears on the *conductor* and *player* pages. This could be utilized to balance the volume across smartphone devices.

Special care should be taken on the extended intervals of immobility of the performers. To mitigate immobility issues a performance may integrate slight movements. Any deviations from the text score shall be made on the following basis:

- The perfornance should emanate a "frozen" atmosphere.
- The performance is a snapshot of a process that unfolds in time. The movement of people along a line.
- A spectator may attend the event from seconds, to minutes to the whole performance. She may be present from the beginning, or come moments before the end.
- The ambient soundscape is part of the piece. Could be used in contrast with the stillness of the performers, metaphorically, aesthetically etc.
- The performance is realized in *public space*. It should permit to ignore it.
