      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p><span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> is a piece of performance art for public space. A group of people arranged in a line is moving towards a point. The spectator faces a snapshot of this proccess. <span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> is based on the <span class="italics">text score:</span></p>
      <!-- Text score -->
      <p class="italics" id="textScore">Night.</p>
      <p id="textScore">People with wooden faces.<br>Moving towards the same point</p>
      <p id="textScore">One behind the other.<br>Close enough or far apart.</p>
      <p id="textScore">Time at still.</p>
      <!--  -->
      <p> The ambient soundscape is part of the piece. Along with it a random endless sequence of notes unfolds. This sequence is distributed on the devices of the performers.</p>
      <p><span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> despite it's static form, deals with motion. The relentless motion of <span class="italics">Time</span>. Which interwines with the footsteps of passers-by. With the roar of the city. With the thoughts, dreams, memories and aspirations of the people that stand frozen in the row.</p>
