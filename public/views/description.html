      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p><span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> is a piece of performance art for public space. A group of people arranged in a line is moving towards a point. The spectator faces a snapshot of this proccess. <span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> is based on the <span class="italics">text score</span></p>
      <!-- Text score -->
      <p>Night.<br>
	People with wooden faces.<br>
	Moving towards the same point<br>
	One behind the other.<br>
	Close enough or far apart.<br>
	Time at still.<br>
      </p>
      <!--  -->
      <p>Part of the piece is the ambient soundscape. Along with it a random endless melody unfolds. This melody is distributed on the devices of performers.</p>
      <p><span class="italics">Human Sound Sculpture</span> despite it's static form, deals with motion. The relentless motion of <span class="italics">Time</span>. Which interwines with the footsteps of passers-by. With the roar of the city. With the thoughts, dreams, memories and aspirations of people the standing frozen in the row.</p>
