TITLE:: Human Sound Sculpture
SUMMARY:: Overview
CATEGORIES:: Help

EMPHASIS::Human Sound Sculpture:: is a piece for human performers and algorithmic sound. It should be played outdoors in places like city parks, town squares, etc. This place must be quiet enought so that the overall amplitude of the piece stays in relative low levels and the frozen atmosphere is not destroyed.

The performance simply starts and lasts as long as the performers have decided. Similarly, the performance simply stops and the performers are leaving silently taking distinct paths.
